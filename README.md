# Balans: Bandit-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search
**Balans** ([IJCAI'25](https://coin-or.github.io/balans/)) is an online-learning meta-solver designed to tackle Mixed-Integer Programming problems (MIPs) through multi-armed bandit-based adaptive large neighborhood search strategy, ALNS(MIP).

The framework integrates several powerful components into a highly configurable, modular, extensible, solver-agnostic, open-source software: 
* [MABWiser](https://github.com/fidelity/mabwiser/) for contextual multi-armed bandits
* [ALNS](https://github.com/N-Wouda/ALNS/) for adaptive large neighborhood search
* [SCIP](https://scipopt.org/) and [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) for solving mixed-integer linear programming problems. 

**ParBalans** ([Arxiv'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06736)) extends this framework with parallelization strategies at both the outer configuration level and the inner branch-and-bound level to exploit modern multicore architectures. 

More broadly, Balans is an integration technology at the intersection of adaptive search, meta-heuristics, multi-armed bandits, and mixed integer programming. When configured with a single neighborhood, it generalizes and subsumes prior work on Large Neighborhood Search for MIP, LNS(MIP). A detailed description of the framework, algorithms, and experimental results can be found in our [IJCAI'25 presentation](https://nbviewer.org/github/skadio/skadio.github.io/blob/master/files/2025_IJCAI_Balans_Kadioglu.pdf).

Balans is a collaborative effort between academia and industry, developed by Brown University, the University of Southern California, and the AI Center of Excellence at Fidelity Investments. The project is contributed to the [COIN-OR Foundation](https://www.coin-or.org/).

## Quick Start - Balans
```python
# Balans meta-solver for solving mixed-integer programming problems
from balans.solver import Balans

# Balans with default configuration
balans = Balans()

# Solve
result = balans.solve("mip_instance.mps")

# Results
print("Best solution:", result.best_state.solution())
print("Best solution objective:", result.best_state.objective())
```

To supply a custom JSON configuration file, e.g., [`default.json`](https://github.com/coin-or/balans/blob/main/balans/configs/default.json):
```python
from balans.solver import Balans
balans = Balans(config="/path/to/config.json")
```

To run directly from the command line after `pip install balans`:
```bash
> balans mip_instance.mps
> balans mip_instance.mps config.json
```

To run programmatically with a custom configuration, see [`main_balans.py`](https://github.com/coin-or/balans/blob/main/main_balans.py).

## How does Balans work?
Balans is a meta-solver that sits on top of a MIP solver (e.g., SCIP, Gurobi) and iteratively improves the solution to a MIP instance by applying a sequence of destroy and repair operators. The selection of these operators is guided by a multi-armed bandit algorithm that learns which operators are most effective at improving the solution over time.

### Intended Use Case
Balans, as a meta-heuristic solver, cannot provide optimality guarantees. Instead, it is intended for finding good solutions to **extremely challenging instances** that cannot be solved with MIP solvers to find optimality or cannot be solved with primal heuristics to find good solutions quickly. 

If you have a challenging MIP instance that _cannot be solved to optimality with a MIP solver_, or _does not admit good-quality heuristic solutions in short amount of time_, then Balans is your friend! 🤗 

### Create a Balans solver
You can create a Balans solver using 
1. Default configuration as `balans = Balans()`.
1. JSON configuration file as `balans = Balans(config="/path/to/config.json")`.
2. Constructor settings as `balans = Balans(destroy_ops, repair_ops, accept, stop, ...)`). 
 
The parameters specify the destroy and repair operators to consider, the rewards and the learning policy for the multi-armed bandit algorithm, the acceptance criteria for neighborhood exploration, the stopping condition, and other settings such as time limits and the MIP solver to use.

### Run the Balans solver
When you run Balans solver on a given instance, `balans.solve("mip_instance.mps")`, Balans first reads the MIP instance from the specified path using the built-in reader of the underlying MIP solver. Then, it attempts to (1) find an initial solution, and (2), improve it until stopping condition is met.

#### 1) Finding an initial solution 
First, Balans tries to find an initial solution running the mip solver with `timelimit_first_solution` seconds. Notice that this might find more than one solution until hitting the time limit and the best found solution becomes the initial solution. 

You can skip this step by providing an initial solution dictionary to Balans via `balans.solve("mip_instance.mps", index_to_val)`. This sets variable values according to `index_to_val` dictionary before starting the search. This can even be partial to guide the MIP solver in its search for the initial solution. 

In case finding an initial solution fails, Balans will restart the MIP solver to find a _single feasible solution_ within the remaining the time limit. If this also fails within the timelimit, Balans will terminate without any solution. 😢

#### 2) Improving the solution
After obtaining an initial solution, Balans will enter the main ALNS search loop and iteratively apply destroy and repair operators to improve the solution. The multi-armed bandit algorithm will update its beliefs about which operators are most effective based on the observed improvements in the solution. The reward mechanism can be configured via `scores=[best, better, accept, rejet]` parameter of the `selector` object which specifies the reward for finding a new best solution (best), improving the current solution (better), accepting the solution (accept), or rejecting the solution (reject).

This loop runs until the specified stop condition is met, e.g., maximum number of iterations, time limit, or no improvement.  

The runtime for each ALNS iteration is limited by `timelimit_alns_iteration` seconds, except for local branching operator, which is a costlier operator and is limited by `timelimit_local_branching_iteration` seconds. The crossover operator requires finding a random solution to crossover with the current solution. This is limited by `timelimit_crossover_random_feasible` seconds. The proximity operator, which alters the original objective function, uses `big_m` to avoid infeasibility. 

## Quick Start - ParBalans

**ParBalans** ([Arxiv'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06736)) extends this framework with parallelization strategies at both the outer configuration level, `n_jobs`, and the inner branch-and-bound level, `n_mip_jobs` to exploit modern multicore architectures.

```python
# Parallel version of Balans, that runs several configurations parallely
from balans.solver import ParBalans

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # ParBalans to run different Balans configs in parallel and save results
    parbalans = ParBalans(n_jobs=2,           # Outer-level: parallel Balans configurations
                          n_mip_jobs=1,       # Inner-level: parallel BnB search. Only supported by Gurobi solver
                          mip_solver="scip",
                          output_dir="parbalans_results/",
                          balans_generator=ParBalans.TOP_CONFIGS)

    # Run a mip instance to retrieve several results 
    instance_path = "mip_instance.mps"
    best_solution, best_objective = parbalans.run(instance_path)

    # Results of the best found solution and the objective
    print("Best solution:", best_solution)
    print("Best solution objective:", best_objective)
```

The `balans_generator` function decides which configuration to run for each parallel process. By default, `ParBalans.TOP_CONFIGS` is used, which generates several configurations listed under `/balans/configs/top_configs/*.json`. These were selected based on their performance across a wide range of MIP instances. Alternatively, `ParBalans.RANDOM_CONFIGS` runs random configurations by sampling from a configuration space. You can provide your own generator function that returns a list of Balans configurations of size `n_jobs` to specify the configurations to run in parallel.
